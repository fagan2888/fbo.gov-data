<p>The notices are broken out into two parts. One file has records with the unique id for each notice, and almost all of the related data fields. The other file with the _desc suffix has the unique id for each notice and a longer prose field that includes the description of the notice. Additionally, the numbers at the end of the file name indicate the year range. So, fbo_data_archive_00_04.csv is for the years 2000-2004. The first files, fbo_data_active.csv, contain all the active solicitations in FBO.gov right now.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the GSA refused to disclose the contact information for contracting officers from the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, citing FOIA exemption 5 U.S.C S 552(b)(6), an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. These contract officers make their emails public on each solicitation they post on FBO.gov, thus their emails have already been made public at one time. We’re also unsure why contracting officers from two specific departments warrant this exception, but others don’t.  We will likely raise this issue before the D.C. District Court judge.</p>
<p>Despite the partial denial, these notices will allow the public and Sunlight’s developers to do a close analysis of government contracting patterns. They include information about who is granting contracts, to whom contracts are being granted, what is being contracted for, and how much those contracts are worth. This will allow us to look for connections and patterns that could implicate government waste or corruption. It will also allow us to analyze the accuracy of information that the government is reporting elsewhere, including on <a href="usaspending.gov">USASpending.gov</a>.</p>
